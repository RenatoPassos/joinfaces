This project enables [JSF](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html) usage inside [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Application.

It autoconfigures 
[PrimeFaces](https://primefaces.org/), 
[PrimeFaces Extensions](http://primefaces-extensions.github.io/), 
[OmniFaces](http://omnifaces.org/),
[AdminFaces](https://adminfaces.github.io/site/), 
[Mojarra](https://javaserverfaces.java.net/) and 
[MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org/) libraries to run at embedded 
[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), 
[Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty) or 
[Undertow](http://undertow.io) servlet containers.
It autoconfigures [Weld](http://weld.cdi-spec.org) and [Rewrite](https://www.ocpsoft.org/rewrite/) too.

It also aims to solve [JSF](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) integration features. Current version includes [JSF](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html) and [CDI](https://www.cdi-spec.org/) annotations support and [Spring Security](https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/) JSF Facelet Tag support.

## How to use

[JoinFaces Example](https://github.com/joinfaces/joinfaces-maven-jar-example) shows JSF Spring Boot Starter usage. It may help you to choose the JSF Spring Boot Starter that fits your needs.

`2.x`     | `1.6` to `1.8` | `1.x`       |`2.0` to `2.2`
`3.0` to `3.2`| `1.8`          | `2.0`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.0.x`   | `1.8` to `11`  | `2.1`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.1.x`   | `1.8` to `12`  | `2.2`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.3.x`   | `1.8` to `14`  | `2.3`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.4.x`   | `1.8` to `15`  | `2.4`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.5.x`   | `1.8` to `16`  | `2.5`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.6.x`   | `1.8` to `16`  | `2.6`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`4.7.x`   | `1.8` to `17`  | `2.7`       |`2.0` to `2.3`
`5.0.x`   | `17` to `19`   | `3.0`       |`3.0` to `4.0`
`5.1.x`   | `17` to `20`   | `3.1`       |`3.0` to `4.0`

This are the combinations we have tested and expect to work, but depending on the features you are using, other combinations might work, too.
When using Java 9 or higher, make sure to use JoinFaces only on the classpath and not on the modulepath.
