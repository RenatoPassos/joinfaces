== Build Tools integration

=== Maven Plugin

JoinFaces provides `org.joinfaces:joinfaces-maven-plugin` https://maven.apache.org[Maven] plugin to configure a classpath scan at build-time in order to reduce the startup time of applications which use an embedded servlet container.

If you have any problems with the classpath scan, you can remove it from plugin section in your `pom.xml` or disable it:
[source,sh]
----
-Djoinfaces.skip=true
----


=== Gradle Plugin

JoinFaces provides some https://gradle.org/[Gradle] plugins to simplify the development.

NOTE: When using the JoinFaces Gradle plugins, you might want to use the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring-boot-version}/reference/html/using.html#using.build-systems.gradle[Spring Boot gradle plugin], too.

==== `org.joinfaces`

The `org.joinfaces` plugin is the main plugin. It does nothing on it's own, but conditionally applies
the other plugin in reaction to the plugins present in the project.

TIP: If defaults in the `org.joinfaces` plugin don't work for you, you can just include the sub-plugins you need instead.

==== `org.joinfaces.dependency-management`

This plugin is applied by the main plugin if the https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[`io.spring.dependency-management` plugin] is applied to the current project.
If this plugin is applied directly it will apply the `io.spring.dependency-management` itself.

In both cases it configures the dependency management plugin to use the JoinFaces <<bom>>.

This is similar to what the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring-boot-version}/gradle-plugin/reference/html/#managing-dependencies[Spring Boot Gradle plugin does].

==== `org.joinfaces.classpath-scan`

This plugin configures a classpath scan at build-time in order to reduce the startup time of applications which use an
embedded servlet container.

For each source-set the `runtimeClasspath` configuration and the output of the compile tasks for `java`, `groovy`,
`scala` and `kotlin` will be scanned.

If you have any problems with the classpath scan, you can disable it:
[source,groovy]
----
scanClasspath.enabled = false
----
